Cataract-Prediction

This is a machine learning project for predicting the presence of cataracts in eye images. The project is built using Flask web framework and is deployed as a web application.

Dataset

The dataset used in this project is obtained from Kaggle. It contains a total of 4200 eye images, with 1294 images showing cataracts and 2873 images without cataracts.

Model

The machine learning model used in this project is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built using TensorFlow. The model is trained on the dataset to predict the presence of cataracts in eye images.

Flask Web Application

The Flask web application allows users to upload an eye image and receive a prediction of the presence of cataracts. The user interface is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Usage

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Install the required packages using pip install -r requirements.txt.
   
4. Navigate to the project directory and run python app.py to start the Flask server.

5. Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:5000.
